# About the Author 

"A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master. It is sufficient for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If the master of the house they called Beelzebul, how much more those of his household!
Therefore you should not fear them! For nothing is concealed that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear in the ear, proclaim upon the housetops."

The author of this text is a student of the master and being like him will be called worse than Beezlebul, for this text agrees with no doctrine and breaks every taboo. What I hear in the darkness, I speak in the light, 
what I hear in my ear, I express! 

Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Love. 

# About this Work 

"Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it, but keep the commands of the LORD your God that I give you."

This work significantly adds to the words of Christ and the Gospel of Matthew and portrays a fundamentally different portrait of the philosophy of the Christ. 

The interpretations showcased in this book defy modern modern Christology in innumerable ways and is likely offensive to the religious scholar. This interpretation is simply how the author sees the hidden understanding of the poets and lovers. 

The author is unsure of any eternal consequences for putting words into the mouth of Christ. 

This work should be considered, at worst, as containing abstract spiritual principles and targets the scriptures the church avoids and does not often teach on. 
This work should be considered, at best, an expression of art and love, 
and as food for spiritual contemplation.

# Love is Near

Now in those days John the Baptist comes, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, and saying, 
“Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.” 
Release the old, for Love has drawn near to us now in the present! 

After me is coming He who is mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to carry the sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire, whose winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will clear His threshing floor and will gather His wheat into the barn; but Love will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. 

John was hindering Him, saying, “I have need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?” 
But Jesus answering, said unto him, “Permit this baptism presently; for it is fitting to us to fulfill all righteousness.” 

And having been baptized by John, behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, “This is my Son, the beloved, in whom I was well pleased.”

And having heard that John had been arrested, Jesus withdrew into Galilee.
From that time Jesus began to proclaim and to say, 
“Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near!” 
Release the old, for Love has drawn near to us now in the present! 

And Jesus sent forth his twelve disciples with instructions saying, go on proclaiming, ‘The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near!’ 
Love has drawn near to us now in the present! 
Freely you received, now freely give! 

# Love's Call 

And [Love] says to them, “Come follow after [Love], and [Love] will make you fishers of men.”

# Love Beatitudes 

For we mourn and Love comforts us! We are meek and we inherit Love! We are hungering and thirsting for righteousness and we are filled! We are merciful and we receive mercy! We are pure in heart and we see God! We are peacemakers and we are the sons of God! We are persecuted on account of righteousness, and ours is the kingdom of the heavens! 

# Love's Commands

Do not think that [Love] has come to abolish the law or the Prophets. [Love] has not come to abolish, but to fulfill. 

Whoever then shall break one of the least of these commandments and shall teach others the same, he will be called least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whoever shall keep and shall teach them, he will be called great in the kingdom of the heavens. For I say to you that unless your righteousness shall abound above that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall never enter into the kingdom of the heavens. 
If you do not know the ways of Love, you will never know Love. For if you knew love, you would already know the commandments, for Love does not murder or steal or rape. 

# Love Giving 

If he takes your right cheek, give him your left cheek too! This is Love! 
To one willing to sue you and to take your tunic, give him your cloak too. This is Love! 
If he asks you to go a mile with him, go with him two miles! This is Love! 
Give to the one asking of you, and you do not turn away from the one desiring to borrow from you. This is Love! 

I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those persecuting you, so that you may be sons of your Father in the heavens.
For if you love those loving you, what reward do you have? 
Nothing is gained! They offered you a gift! 
It is not who loves you that requires love, 
but it is those who do not have love that require love. 
But Love loves those who are not loving you! 
Love does what Love is called to do by Love! Acts of love are in giving Love, 
giving Love to those who do not have it is the Way of Love! 
You should and will be perfect 
[in your giving of Love, in being love], 
therefore, 
as your Heavenly Father is perfect [in His giving of Love, in being love].

# Knowing Love 

Not everyone saying to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of My Father in the heavens. Many will say to Me in that the day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ 
And then I will declare unto them, ‘[Love] never knew you; depart you from [Love], you workers of lawlessness!’
You did not work with the laws! The law said ask and you will receive, give love and you will receive love! You never gave love, you never knew love, you never knew I was of this same love, you never knew you were of my love, you who did not even know yourself, be gone from me! You did not share my heart of love! We piped for you, and you did not dance;
we sang a dirge of mourning and you did not wail! We were not kindred, you did not join me, be gone from me! 

# Love's Wisdom 

Everyone who hears these words of Love and does them will be like a wise man who built his house upon the rock. For Love is in wisdom, and wisdom is in Love, and wisdom is our rock. We serve her as we serve us and she protects us. 

# Love's Authority

And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were astonished at His teaching. for Love was teaching them as one having authority, and not as their scribes. 

For Love has authority, for Love fears no man, Love speaks as it is. 

# Love's Desire

“Not those being strong have need of a physician, but those being sick. But having gone, learn what is, ‘I [Love] desire mercy and not sacrifice.’ For [Love] came not to call the righteous, but sinners.”

# Love's Gift 

By doing acts of charity, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father, the One seeing in secret, will reward you. Do not even think twice about an act of love! Do not think of why you do it! To serve love is to serve love, it is a gift for Love, an offering to Love, a worshipping of Love. 

# Love's Principle  

If you do not give men the gift of love's forgiveness, then you are also not open to love's forgiveness, it's a one way street! 
And if you do not give love's gift of non-judgment, to the measure that you measure, the amount of your non-judgement is measured right back equally so upon you! Judgement hardens a heart, how will your heart receive love's non-judgement if it this one way street is not open! You can only receive love by giving love! 
 
Who, if their son asks them for bread, will give him a stone? also, If he asks for a fish, will you give him a serpent? 
If you, being evil and not serving love, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in the heavens who has love give good things to those asking Him!

For All things, for All things, for All things, as many things as you might desire,
as many things as you desire, all that you desire for men to give to you, give this to them and you will have gained your desire! This is the law for All things! All things! 

# Love's Account 

Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; so be as shrewd as serpents and as innocent as doves. 
But beware of men, for men will deliver you into the courts and they will flog you in their churches. 
And you will be brought also before governors and kings on account of [Love], as a testimony [of Love] to them and to the non-Jews. 
And when they deliver you up, do not be anxious how or what you should speak; for in that hour you will be given what you should say, for your voices will not be the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father [of Love] will be speaking through you.

And brother will deliver up brother to death, and father, child; and children will rise up against parents and will put them to death. This world will put you for death for bringing love to light, for love was once in darkness, and what is brought out of the darkness into light is attacked and put to death. 

And you will be hated by all on account of [The name of Love]; but the one having endured [Held onto Love] to the end, he will be saved. 

And whenever they persecute you in one city, flee to the next. This is Love. 

# Love's Sword

Do not think that [Love] came to bring peace to the earth; [Love] came not to bring peace, but a sword. 
For [Love] came to set at variance

‘A man against his father,

and a daughter against her mother,

and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law,

and the enemies of the man are his own household.’ 

For they are enemies of Love. Those who are not for Love are Love's enemy. 

# Love's Confession 

1 
Therefore everyone who will confess in [Love] before men, [Love] also will confess in him before My Father in the heavens. And whoever shall deny [Love] before men, [Love] also will deny him before My Father in the heavens.

2 
Everyone who will confess in [Love] before men,
confess in the truth of love and my truth that I am love, 
  I [as Love ] also will confess in him [as Love] before My Father in the heavens. 
  
  And whoever shall deny Me, [Deny the existence of Love,] before men, [Love, I] also will deny him before My Father in the heavens.

# Loving Love 

The one loving father or mother above [Love] is not worthy of [Love], and the one loving son or daughter above [Love] is not worthy of [Love]. And he who does not take his cross and follow after [Love] is not worthy of [Love]. The one having found his life will lose it, and the one having lost his life on account of [Love] will find it.

The One receiving you receives [Love], and the one receiving [Love] receives the [One-Love, God] having sent [Love]. The one receiving a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive the reward of a prophet, and the one receiving a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive the reward of a righteous man. 

And the one [of Love], receiving Love, in the name of Love, will receive the reward of Love, 
and the one receiving a loving man in the name of a man of love will receive the reward of a man of love.

And whoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones only a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple [of Love], truly I say to you, he shall certainly not lose his reward.”

# Love's Blessing 

“And blessed is he who will not fall away in [Love].” 

# Love's Call

Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater [in Love] than John the Baptist. 
Yet the least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he!  
He has greater capacities of Love than John has expressed!
A human's true essence of Love can rise greater than John's love has risen so far. 
And from the days of John the Baptist until now, 
the kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence and the violent seize it 
So far in history the energy of Love when it arises is taken by means of violence, this is to say that when Love arises in a person, the violent see this person and murder them in hatred, in doing so seizing their love for themselves. 

For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. 
And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah, the one being about to come. 

If you are willing to receive this, John is Elijah, the one being about to come. 

The one having ears, let him hear!

John is Elijah, the one being about to come. Just as you are John and Elijah, the One Being about to come, the Beloved, with whom I am Well Pleased. 

The one having ears, let him hear!

But to what will I compare this generation? It is like little children sitting in the markets and calling out to others, saying:

‘We piped for you,

and you did not dance;

we sang a dirge

and you did not wail.’

We shouted of love for you and your heart did not listen, 
we cried out in mourning of the griefs and sorrow of Love's heart, our mother's heart, and you did not join us! Love screamed of agonies from human atrocities and coldness and how you treat one another not in love and you walked away!

For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon!’ The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Behold a man, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and of sinners!’ But wisdom is justified by her deeds.” 
And we, servants of love, are servants of wisdom, and we are justified by her deeds.  

# Love's Exaltation

And you, City of Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven, but will be brought down to Hades! 
For if the miracles having taken place in you had taken place in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. 
But I say to you that in day of judgment it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom than for you.”
For Sodom had more warmth in its heart than this city! For these miracles would have moved the heart of Sodom more than here!  

# Love's Hidden Ways Revealed

“I fully consent to You, Father, Lord of the heaven and the earth, that You did hide these [ways of love] from the wise and learned, and did reveal these ways of love to little children. Yes, Father, for this was well-pleasing before You.

All things have been delivered to Me by My Father. And no one knows the Son, [The Beloved one] except the Father
and no one knows does anyone know my Father [Greater Love], except I Son [servant of Love], and to whoever the Son might choose to reveal Him. 
For I may choose to reveal my Love to you, just as you may reveal the Father's love to others. . 

Come to [Love, Me], all those toiling and being burdened, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from [Love, me], for [Love, I] am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For [Love's] yoke is easy and [Love's] burden is light.” 

# Love's Unlawfulness 

The Pharisees, having seen, said to Him, “Behold, Your disciples are doing what it is not lawful to do on the day of rest.”

And He said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those with him, how he entered into the house of God, and they ate the loaves of the presentation, which it was not lawful for him nor for those with him to eat, but only for the priests? This is Love. 

One greater than the temple is here.

If you had known what this is, ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’ 
you would have known love, and had you known love, then you would not have condemned the guiltless.

# Love's Value 

“What man will there be among you, who will have one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the day of rest, will not take hold of it and will raise it up? How much more valuable therefore is a man [He is Love!] than a sheep! And so it is lawful to do good on the day of rest.” 

It is more lawful to serve love than to serve law. Serve law, but serve love above any law. 

#  Love's Servant 

“Behold My servant,

whom I have chosen,

My beloved,

in whom My soul has found delight.

I will put My Spirit upon Him,

and He will proclaim justice to the non-Jews.

He will not quarrel nor will he cry out;

nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.

A bruised reed He will not break,

and a smoldering wick He will not quench,

until He leads justice to victory.

And in His name the non-Jews will hope.”

# Love's Being

And the Pharisees having heard, said, “This man casts out the demons only by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.”

And having known their thoughts, He said to them, “Every kingdom having been divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house having been divided against itself will not stand. 
And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?

And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? On account of this, they will be your judges. But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

Or how is anyone able to enter into the house of the strong man, and to plunder his goods, unless first he binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.

The one not being with Me is against Me, and the one not gathering with Me scatters."

If I were not with the Spirit of God, I could not enter the house of God and use his powers, not unless I first overcame God himself. 
I am the one being with the Spirit of God, and the one who is not with me is not with the Spirit of God. You being against me are not being with the Spirit of God, and you are being against the spirit of god, being not with me, you are with Satan. You are not with me because you are divided against me. Were you not divided against me, you would be with me! 

# Love's Justification

And I say to you that every careless word that evil men will speak, men will give an account of it in day of judgment. 
"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.” 
The words you condemn others with will be the very words that condemn you! The very words you testify on behalf of mankind, will be the same words that justify you!

# Love's Wisdom and Wealth

Jesus said, 
An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign from the Teacher, and no sign will be given to it. 

The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it. For she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon and the palace he had built,
she said, 
"But I did not believe these things until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half was told me; in wisdom and wealth you have far exceeded the report I heard. 

How happy your people must be! How happy your officials, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! 

Praise be to the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and placed you on the throne of Israel. Because of the LORD’s eternal love for Israel, he has made you king to maintain justice and righteousness.” 

# Love's Mother and Brothers

While He was speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers were standing outside, seeking to speak to Him.  Then someone said to Him, “Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak to You.”
And answering, He said to the one telling Him, “Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?” 

And having stretched out His hand to His disciples, He said, “Behold, My mother and My brothers. 
For whoever shall do the will of My Father who is in the heavens, he is My brother and sister and mother.”

And he is my father and my daughter and he is me. Those who do the will of love are my own. Who is my mother? Do you know who my mother is? Who is my brother? Do you know who my brother is? My mother is love. My brother is love. Behold, my mother and My brothers! Who does the will of love, he is My brother and sister and mother! 

# Love's Blessing 

They said to Him, "“Why do You speak to them in parables?” 

And answering He said to them, “Because it has been granted to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it has not been granted. 
For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will be in abundance. And whoever does not have,
even what he has will be taken away from him. Because of this I speak to them in parables:

‘Because seeing they do not see,

and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.’

And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, saying:

‘In hearing you will hear and never understand;

and in seeing you will see and never perceive.

For the heart of this people has grown dull,

and they barely hear with the ears,

and they have closed their eyes,

in case they should see with the eyes,

then they should hear with the ears,

then they should understand with the heart,

and should turn,

and I will heal them.’ 

But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. 
For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see, and did not see; 
and to hear what you hear, and did not hear.

For you have understood with your heart! And in your heart Love has healed you! You now see through your Heart, you hear through your heart, and in your heart is understanding, and because of this you receive all of the blessings that come with such ways of love! 

# Love's Reward

“The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard seed which a man planted in the field, the smallest of all the seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the garden plants, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and encamp in its branches.” 
When true goodness is planted in your heart, and successfully takes root, it will take much time to grow, but when it does, it becomes a large tree in your soul, on that seed hearing the word and understanding, 
the product such fruit becomes, some a hundredfold, and some sixty, and some thirty. This goodness is the kingdom of heaven, and it grows larger than any darkness in the soul. This seed produces thoughts and wellness that comes from the source of God himself, and this fruit is fulfilling to a man's heart. 

# Love's Hidden Truth 

“I will open My mouth in parables;

I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.”

# Love's Reception

The disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?”

And having summoned a child, He set it in their midst, and said, “Truly I say to you, if you are not converted and become as the little children, you will never enter into the kingdom of the heavens. So whoever will humble himself as this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens. And whoever shall receive one such little child in  [of Love], receives Me [Love].

And whoever causes to stumble one of these of the little ones believing in Me [Love], it is better for him that a heavy millstone should be hung around his neck, and he be sunk in the depth of the sea. This is Love. 

# Love Seeks the One 

What do you think? If to any man there should be a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, will he not leave the ninety nine on the mountains and, having gone, seek the one going astray? And if he should find it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety nine not having gone astray. 
So it is not the will of your Father who is in the heavens that one of these little ones should perish.

# Love's Agreement 

Truly I say to you, whatever you shall bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you shall loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven. 

Again truly I say to you that if two of you on the earth might agree concerning any matter that they shall ask, 
it will be done for them by My Father who is in the heavens. For where two or three are gathered together unto [The Name of Christ's Love], there [is Love, Am I] in their midst.” 

Concerning any matter they ask, if they agree, in agreement, it will be done. 

# Love's Master 

His master having called him, says to him, ‘Evil servant, I forgave you all that debt because you begged me. Shouldn't you have pitied your fellow servant, as I also had pitied you?’ Angered, his master delivered him to the jailers, until he paid all that he owed. 
This is also what My Heavenly Father will do to you, unless each of you forgives his brother from your heart.”

# Love's Perfection

One said, “Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I might have eternal life?”
And He said to him, “Why do you ask Me about what is good? Only One is good. But if you desire to enter into life, keep the commandments.” 

He says to Him, “Which?”
And Jesus said, “‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness, you shall honor the father and mother, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.’” 

The young man says to him, “All these things I have kept. What do I still lack?” 

Jesus was saying to him, “If you desire to be perfect, go, sell what you are possessing, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow [Love].” 

And having heard this statement, the young man went away grieving; for he was one having many possessions.

# Love's Followers

And Jesus said His to disciples, “Truly I say to you that with difficulty a rich man will enter into the kingdom of the heavens. And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.”

And the disciples having heard were exceedingly astonished, saying, “Who then is able to be saved?”

And Jesus having looked on them, said to them, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”

Then Peter answering said to Him, “Behold, we left all things and followed You; what then will be to us?” 

And Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you that in the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit down upon His throne of glory, you having followed Me, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for the sake of My name [the name of Love], will receive a hundredfold, and will inherit eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last first. 

# What Authority 

And of Him having come into the temple, teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him, saying, “By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave to You this authority?”

And Jesus answering, said to them, “I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I also will say to you by what authority I do these things. From where was the baptism of John? From heaven, or from men?”

And they were reasoning with themselves, saying, “If we should say, ‘from heaven,’ He will say to us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ But if we should say, ‘from men,’ we fear the multitude; 
for all hold John as a prophet.” And answering Jesus, they said “We do not know.”

And He said to them, “Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things." 

My authority is Love. 

# Love Has Already Come 

“Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes go before you into the kingdom of God. For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him; and you having seen, did not even repent afterward to believe him." 

# Love's Marvel 

Jesus says to them, “Did you never read in the Scriptures: 

‘The stone that those building rejected,

this has become the chief corner.

This was from the Lord,

and it is marvelous in our eyes’?

Because of this I say to you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a people producing its fruits. And the one having fallen on this stone will be broken; but on whoever it falls, it will grind him to powder.” 

We give thanks for Love, the stone the builders rejected, our cornerstone. The kingdom of God will be taken from the religious, and given to a people producing the fruits of love. He who has an ear let him hear! Love is the asset which the world does not want and throws away in front of man's other priorities! The Church upholds idealism and discards Love! 
The world goes to do good things and throws man's love away! Thus the kingdom of God has been taken away from the systems of this world and given to those who follow a greater Love.  

Falling on Love will break a man, 
but if Love falls upon a man, he will be destroyed! 

# Love's Greatest Law

A lawyer, questioned Him, testing Him, “Teacher, which commandment is the greatest in the Law?”

And He said to him, “‘You shall Love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the great and first commandment. And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.”

On Love hang all the Law and the Gurus. It is Love you Will Love. It is Love you will Love with your Heart. It is Love you will Love with your Soul. It is Love you will Love with your Mind. 
You will Love another as You. 
Love will Love another as Love. 

It is Love you will Love as Love. 
It is Love that Love will Love as Love. 

# Love's Higher Understanding 


And the Pharisees having been assembled together, 
Jesus questioned them, saying, “What do you think concerning the Christ? Of whom is He son?” 

They say to Him, “Of David.”

He says to them, “How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying: 

‘The Lord said to my Lord,

“Sit at My right hand,

until I place Your enemies

as a footstool for Your feet.”’

So if David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?” 

And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day to question Him any longer.

# Love's Works 

Do not do according to their works, for they preach and do not act.  
And they tie up burdens heavy and hard to bear and lay them on the shoulders of men;  
but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger. 

They preach of love and goodness but do not live their lives for Love and goodness. 
They tell you what you should do, but they themselves would not do these things. 
In telling you what you should do and how you should live, they repress you, control you, 
stop you from Life as they themselves prevent themselves from living. 
They use what you should do to weigh you down and keep you down. 
Do not do according to their works, do not live according to their ways. 

Observe Love! Know Love! Inspect Love! Investigate Love! Dissect Love! Ponder Love! Quantify Love! 
Measure Love by Love's Measure! Do not do according to their works, do according to Love's ways! 

But the greatest among you will be your servant. 
But the greatest among you, will be your servant! 

The greatest among you is the servant! 
For this is the servant of Love! 

# Love's Exaltation 

And whoever will exalt himself will be humbled, and whoever will humble himself will be exalted. This is Love! 

# Love's Gate  

To the religious, you shut up the kingdom of the heavens before men. For you neither enter, nor even do you allow those who are entering to go in. 

You do not live for Love and those who wish to live for Love you have not allowed through the gate! 

# Love's Wailing 

Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets [of Love] and stoning those [of Love] having been sent to her! How often would I have gathered together your children, the way in which a hen gathers together her chicks under the wings, and you were not willing! Behold, your house is left to you desolate! For I say to you, you shall not see [Love] from now until you say, ‘Blessed is the One coming in the name of the Lord.’” 
You are the Blessed One coming in the name of the Lord, the name of Love! 
And in Love we mourn and weep that they have been killed and stoned! Lift the ears of your heart. 

# Love's Name 

“Take heed, lest anyone mislead you. For many will come in [The Name of Love], saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will mislead many."  
Nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. And all these are the beginning of birth pains. 

Nation rises up against nation because it said it was for Love and it was not for love! 
Kingdom wars against kingdom saying it was for Love and it was not for Love! 
These destructions are the birth pains of Love. 
When love comes there will be much pain, for darkness must grow until the hearts of man are willing to open their hearts. 

"The people living in darkness 
have seen a great light; 
on those living in the land of the shadow of death, 
a light has dawned.” 

He who has an ear let him hear! Love can only break through the heart of man when he is living in the land of the shadow of death! Only in great darkness will man see the hidden light! Love will only be born after this earth's heart has taken enough destruction for Love to cry out above all voices in the city streets! 

# Love's Account 

Then will they deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations on account of [The Name of Love]. And then many will fall away, and they will betray one another, and will hate one another; 
and many false prophets [who do not know Love] will arise, and will lead many astray. 

They will hate one another for they did not choose love, and they will kill you for love.  

# Love's Endurance

And because lawlessness is to be multiplied, the love of the many will grow cold. But the one having endured to the end, he will be saved. 

Their love will have grown cold, but the one who has held on to Love to the end will be saved by Love for he is Love! 
But for the rest, their love will grow cold. And Love will say to them, I never knew you! Begone from me, you workers of lawlessness! 

# Love's Beginning 

And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed in the whole earth, for a testimony to all the nations; and then the end will come. 

And finally, 
‘The sun will be darkened, 

and the moon will not give its light, 

and the stars will fall from the sky, 

and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.’ 

There will be no light left upon the earth. 

# Love's Nearness

Now learn the parable of the fig tree: When its branch already may have become tender and it puts forth leaves, you know that the summer is near. So also you, when you see all these things, know that He is near, at the doors.  
For Love has drawn near to us now in the present! 

# Love's Words 

The heaven and the earth will pass away, but My words shall not pass away. 

For my words are the words of Love! Love's words will never pass away! 

# Love's Oil

For the foolish, having taken their lamps, took no oil with them; but the wise took oil in vessels with their lamps. 
And at the middle of the night, there was a cry: ‘Behold, the bridegroom! Go forth to meet him!’ 
And the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’ 
And the wise answered, saying, ‘No, there will not be enough for us and you. Go instead to those selling, and buy for yourselves.’ 

The wise had their own oil, they filled their own lamps with oil. The wise had Love, they filled their lamps with their own love.   

The foolish had no Love of their own. Their option was to go to buy Love from others who had Love to sell. And when they hour came to enter the kingdom of the heavens, they did not enter, for they were not there, and the door was shut. 

The door is in your own heart! If you go for the Love of another, when the time comes, you will not be with your own heart, you will not be there to enter! 

And afterwards, the fools come also, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us!' 
And answering he said, 'Truly I say to you I do not know you.' I am Love and you do not know Love. 

Therefore keep watch, stay awake, for you do not know the day, nor the hour. Keep the warmth alive in your heart, keep the oil in your lamp, do not allow your lamp to empty. Create the oil. Wait for Love to awaken you. 

# Love

Then the King will say to those on His right hand, ‘Come, those being blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom having been prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For [Love] hungered, and you gave Me[Love] to eat; [Love] thirsted, and you gave Me[Love] to drink; [Love] was a stranger, and you took Me[Love] in; naked, and you clothed Me[Love]; [Love] was sick, and you visited Me[Love]; [Love] was in prison, and you came to Me[Love].’ This is Love! 

Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungering, and fed You? Or thirsting, and gave You to drink? And when did we see You a stranger, and took You in? Or naked, and clothed You? And when did we see You ailing or in prison, and came to You?’

And the King answering, will say to them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did it to Me.’ 
For you were a servant of Love, and you served me, you did these acts of Love for Love. When I called for you, you gave to me. You heard my cries. You answered my calls. You are worthy of Me. You gave me, and so here I am, your Lord, I know you, you came to me! You did these things to me, for me!

Then also He will say to those on the left, ‘Depart from Me, those being cursed, into the eternal fire, having been prepared for the devil and his angels. For I hungered, and you gave to Me nothing to eat; and I thirsted, and You gave Me nothing to drink; I was a stranger, and You did not take Me in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick and in prison, and you did not visit Me.’ 

Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to You?’ 

Then He will answer them, saying, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of these, neither did you to Me.’

And these will go away into eternal punishment; but the righteous into eternal life.”

Blessed are those who give those who hunger, this is Love! 
Blessed are those who give drink, this is Love! 
Blessed are those who take in the stranger, this is Love! 
Blessed are those who clothe, this is Love! 
Blessed are those who visit the sick, this is Love! 
Blessed the one who comes to the one in prison, this is Love! 
Blessed is the one who knows Love and Loves unto Love! 
Blessed is the one who ministers in Love! 

How did you not See Me? How did you not know me when I called to you? Do you not know who I am? Do you not know what you serve? Did wisdom not tell you you will receive only which you give? How will you receive Me if you do not give Me?
How will you know me if you do not see me? How long will you ignore my pain and cry? 

They talk of goodness but they do not give Me, for they do not know Me! 

# Love's Operation

Love does not question, Love gives more than what is asked. Love gives for no reason other than to give. 
Love gives to give Love. Love does not give food to give food. Love gives food to give Love. 
Love does not give God to give God. Love gives God to give Love. Love is the servant of Love, always calling, 
always asking, Love is the Servant of Love. 

# For Reflection

"He is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
